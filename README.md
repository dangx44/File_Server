# File_Server

3 functions to upload a file, download a file and list all files in Server.
Application works with User input in prompt.
In meantime it uploads a hardcoded file to the Server(Fixed after 2nd commit, now excepts filenames from User).  
When sending a request to download a file the Server receives the filename request.
List all files function doesn't work yet
Last Commit to Server.py was trying to send a file to the client before putting the code into a function.
